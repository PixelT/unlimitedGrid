## TL;DR

* unlimitedGrid is a very small / simple / flexible and functional grid "framework" ( based on Sass )
* Set the properties in the grid.scss file > build / compile this file
* Use the generated classes in your HTML to create & setup your individual grid / layout structure!

## About unlimitedGrid

unlimitedGrid is a collection of ~~functions~~ principles and rules, by which you can easily and fast create an attractive and ( ultra ) functional grid.

unlimitedGrid based on a slightly different approach and mechanism of action than standard grid frameworks available. unlimitedGrid doesn't provide functions, which define the rules / size / behavior for classes which you describe, but immediately generates a whole set of classes based on your settings

unlimitedGrid is very flexible. It allows you to define - among others - such things as the custom number of columns ( 10, 12, 16, 24 or maybe 7? no problem ), custom gutters ( in absolute or relative length units ), class names ( you prefer OOCSS, BEM or another methodology - easy! ), custom breakpoint values and class names for @media - for each module independently, according to your preferences - so you can generate the grid as you need - the only limitation is your imagination...

unlimitedGrid supports grid features like: responsive, gutters, nested, offset, order ( pull / push ), visibility, block - all this things can have custom / different names ( class ) and responsive breakpoints! You decide which modules you want to use in the created grid!
